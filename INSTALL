To build sysmond (pronounced sys-mon-d), just run make.
On most systemd the build time will be less than one second.

If desired, copy the executable, sysmond, to the desired location
such as /usr/sbin.

To start the program just run:
  sudo sysmond [ options ]

Command line options and defaults can be seen by passing
--help on the command line.

To terminate the program run:
  sudo kill $(cat /run/sysmond.pid)

See the ABOUT file for program details.

There are three associated files that are used.

/etc/sysmond.conf:
========
# Ignore lines starting with a hash or blank lines.

#pid-file   /run/sysmond.pid
#debug-file /tmp/sysmond.dbg
#udp-port   12686
#scan-time  1
========

This file is optional, but if not found a warning will be
written to the terminal.  The warning can be silenced
with a sumple "sudo touch /etc/sysmond.conf".

------------
/run/sysmond.pid

This file contains the program ID (pid) of the running process.

-----------
/tmp/sysmond.dbg

This file is created if an error occurs or a signal is sent
to the program:
  sudo kill -SIGUSR1 $(cat /run/sysmond.pid)

This command will dump the current readings of the program
status and tempeerature sensors.
